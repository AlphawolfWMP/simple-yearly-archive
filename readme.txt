= ENGLISH: =
This Plugin completely disables the theme, plugin and core update checking system in WordPress. The plugin prevents WordPress from checking for updates, and prevents any notifications from being displayed.

This Plugin combines und extends the three plugins of John Blackbourn:
* [Disable Wordpress Theme Update](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-wordpress-theme-updates/)
* [Disable Wordpress Plugin Update](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-wordpress-plugin-updates/)
* [Disable Wordpress Core Update](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-wordpress-core-update/)

It's **very** important that you keep your WordPress theme, core and plugins up to date. If you don't, your blog or website could be susceptible to security vulnerabilities or performance issues. If you use this plugin, you must make sure you keep yourself up to date with new releases of your active wordpress version, plugins and themes and update them as new versions are released.


== Installation ==

1. Unzip the ZIP file and drop the folder straight into your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
