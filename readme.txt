== Description ==

Simple Yearly Archive is a rather neat and simple Wordpress plugin that allows you to **display your archives in a year-based list**. It works mostly like the usual WP archive, but displays all published posts seperated by their year of publication. That said, itâ€™s also possible to restrict the output to certain categories, and much more.
